Put the folder 'project' where you want to run it.
You will be prompted at the start of program about the directory of folder.
Please enter only the directory containing 'project' folder. Without ending backslash.
For example - Users/python/new
	    - System/Downloads
It will read default directory to be 'cwd' (current working directory)

#
You can place your test images in 'project/test_data' folder.
You will also be prompted to enter specific image with location to want to test.
(That will always be considered Document0)
By default, the test_data folder contains validation data provided in the problem statement.

#
The program works on Python. So please install Python if not on machine.
It also uses OpenCV Contributors Python library.
On Mac it can be installed using 'pip install opencv-contrib-python' in the terminal.
The system also uses NumPy Library. Make sure you have it installed in the environment.
On Mac it can be installed using 'pip install numpy' in the terminal.

#
Please do not delete folders 'chars', 'dates', and 'ac_nums' and file called 'digits.png' from 'project/res' folder.
The folders 'chars', 'dates' and 'ac_nums' will contain generated data. The folders can be emptied if needed, but do not delete the folders altogether.

#
run 'python <directory>/project/main.py
And you are good to go.

#
Please do not judge by the output file. The output can be improved very easily. The most difficult task was to isolate the required text from data set which has been achieved quite well.
